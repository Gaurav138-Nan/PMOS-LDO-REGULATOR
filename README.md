# PMOS-LDO-REGULATOR
**PMOS LDO**
**Introduction:**
A low voltage drop out regulator abbreviated as LDO regulator is used to regulate voltage. Nowadays different devices use many types of voltages from the same supply voltage and those need to be regulated against current and voltage changes where LDOâ€™s are required to maintain  a constant regulated voltage so that semiconductor devices work properly.

The circuit components: 
Here we have tried to design an LDO with PMOS transistor as a pass transistor.
Before designing it ,we start by identifying the important components comprising of the LDO circuit.
</br>
</br>
1.	Error Amplifier: This amplifier is responsible for tracking any output voltage changes so that
So that the output remains constant with respect to changes .The error amplifier is essentially an op-amp with one input from voltage reference circuit and other from feedback circuit.
</br></br>
2.	Voltage reference: This provides a temperature independent voltage to one of the inputs of the error amplifier. It is generally a voltage bandgap reference circuit.
</br></br>
3.	Feedback circuit: The feedback circuit is basically a resistive divider circuit which divides the output voltage and then applies it to the input of the error amplifier for comparison with the reference voltage.
</br></br>
4.	Pass Transistor: The pass element in the LDO is responsible for transferring current from input to load and is driven by the error amplifier in the feedback loop.

**Our design:**
Here we have designed a PMOS based LDO regulator with the circuit components as mentioned above in LTSPICE software.

Opamp specification used:
</br>
Open Loop Gain= 70db.
</br>
Gain Bandwidth= 8 Mhz.
</br>
ICMR >=1.5V.
</br>
Vin:2.7V to 1.2 V
</br>
Vdd= 3.3V.
</br>
PM>= 60 deg.
</br>

LDO specifications:
</br>
Input voltage range:3.3 V to 5V.
</br>
Output Regulated voltage:2.5 V.
</br>
Maximum Load current:80mA.
</br>
Vdsat:0.25V.
</br>
Vref:1.25V
</br>
Kp:50uA/V2
</br>
Vtp:0.7V.
</br>

**Pass Transistor design:**
Using the current saturation equation we calculate the W/l ratio of PMOS transistor.
Id=0.5*kp(W/L)(Vdsat)2 .
Using the above values into the above equation we get W/L=51.2K.

Therefore the traditional design in ltspice is give below.

The output regulated voltage that we get for the above design is also given below.

</br></br>

**Observations from the above graph:**
From the above graph we can observe that for supply voltage greater than 3V we are able to get a regulated output voltage of 2.5V.This shows us that the dropout voltage is about 3V.


**Load Regulation:**
Now we will observe the load regulation that is the effect of changing load current on the output regulated voltage. For changing the load current we have considered full load current of 80mA and no load current of 0mA.

The below graph shows the output.

</br></br>


**Observation about the above graph:**
The variation of voltage with changing current load is quite minimal but an interesting observation shows us during the step change in the current there is a spike induced at the output voltage.
Theoretically we can explain those spikes because the error amplifier is unable to detect the change as quickly as the load current change(because of slew rate of opamp) therefore momentarily we are observing some spikes.


**Attaching a Load Capacitor:**
Now a question arises ,is it possible to improve the load transient response as observed in the above graph.

One way to improve the load transient response is to introduce a load capacitor. What this capacitor does is to provide the necessary increased current(by discharging through the load) during the time interval in which the error amplifier is able to properly detect the load change so as to increase Vgs of PMOS to provide the necessary increased load current.
Below is the graph on the inclusion of load capacitor.

</br>
</br>

	As observed from the above graph, the load transient response has improved greatly in comparison with our previous design.





**Introducing a phase compensation capacitor :**
Again can we improve the spikes occurring in the above graphs. Even though we improved the transient response but the spikes are still there.

Here we attach a capacitor in parallel with the resistive feedback network.

What this capacitance does is, at very high frequencies it shorts the R1 resistor therefore any change at the output node is directly applied to positive terminal of error amplifier thus the error amplifier is able to detect the changes faster reducing the spikes obtained in our previous variations.






The graph is shown below.

As observed in the above graph ,we have reduced the spikes considerably as compared to our previous designs.
